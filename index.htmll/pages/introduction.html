     <h1> When Food and Literature Collide</h1>
        <p> Literature is more than stories and old-folk tales. Literature provides people with 
        an understanding of deep experiences that they have not yet to even experience and
         insight into experiences from authors that have had/want to share. Throughout this 
         post I want to share the knowledge and experiences that authors have put in effort to 
        present to readers through literarure. More specifically through their choices in mentioning specific foods.
        This will involve specific texts, scenes, and overall detailed descriptions of their implied 
        message they have aimed to have their audience understand. </p>
