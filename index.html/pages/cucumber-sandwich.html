    <h2> Cucumber Sandwiches</h2>
            <h3> "The Importance of Being Earnest" by Oscar Wilde</h3>
                <p> "The Importance of Being Earnest" was a play dedicated towards the riducule
                 of the Victorian era. The Victorian Society involved individuals who had 
                 a questionable sense of style and choices. Within this play Oscar Wilde showed
                  the reality of individuals being greedy and cunning for their own self interest/benefit. 
                  Through satire and comedy, Oscar Wilde uses the characters specifically Algernon and Earnest
                  to present the reality behind being dishonst for one's own benefit and greed. The specific scene
                  that I will be focusing on is the particular scene from 
                 "the Importance of Being Earnest" where Algernon promises to provide his aunt
                  with Cucumber sandwiches, but ate them out of greed and lied when asked about them. </p>
