<h2> Corn Tortilla </h2>
<h3>"The Abuelita Poem" by Paul Martinez</h3>
<p> Withim this recipe, I will be focusing on a poem known as "The Abuelita Poem" written by Paul Martinez. This Poem
    delves deep into the feelings of memories, loss, and family. As the poem goes on he presents the reader with a good
    amount of imagery such as "Her brown skin" and "the hands of centuries-old ancestor spirits" to express his interest 
    in his Abuelita and the culture that lies behind the food she is making. That food being Corn tortillas that she made
    "from scratch". It encapsulates a memory he has of her and how that memory is not only beneficial for future knowledge
    that he will now carry on, but that he can use as in rememberance of her due to her passing.</p>
